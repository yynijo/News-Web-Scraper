# Project Motivation
I wanted to start a habit of regularly reading the news to deepen my financial acumen but found official mobile app notifications overwhelming & not specific to my interests. This led me to develop this bot: To scrape only the financial news sections and deliver headlines.

Since Telegram consistently ranks among my top 5 apps on both mobile (and desktop) in screen time, I chose Telegram as the platform to create this bot. Also, I really liked The Straits Times' Telegram channel and was inspired by it to start this project.

*The bot only sends the link to the articles. You will only be able to view the articles if you yourself have a premium subscription like I do
